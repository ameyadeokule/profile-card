## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Clamp()

### What I learned

-   Using 'Clamp()' to fix an element to the desired place even when resizing.
-   Using CSS Grid to align two or more elements to take up a fix percentage of space on all screen sizes
-   Flexbox to arrange element with respect to the available screen space.
-   Pracrice to only specify the width and let the content of the element decide it's height.

### Continued development

Redo the coding process using Tailwind and use any API to pull in stats and photos in real time.
